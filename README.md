# Randomizer

an application that helps the instructor  who is working online during the lecture to choose a random student for asking and participate and that help to make the student focus more in the lecture,

## feather

* create a list of students in two ways:
    + adding students one by one by the GUI.
    + putting a txt file named "students_list" that contains all students' names in the same location of the randomizer file, the students' names should be separated by a new line.
* ability to update the existing list by appending new names to it.
* ability to update the list (delete or edit name) from the txt file
* making a reset and create a new list.

### instruction

1. python language is needed.

2. go to the dist folder, then open the randomizer file (it's an executable file)

3. when you create a list, a new txt file will be created that contains your data, and the app will read the data from this file, (in this case you can update the list manually there if you like).

**p.s:** when you do a reset, this txt file will be deleted
